## 🎯 Career Transition Focus
**Leveraging 2+ years teaching IT/cybersecurity to break into:**  
- **SOC Analyst** roles (Threat Detection, SIEM)  
- **GRC Analyst** positions (NIST, Risk Management)  

**Key Transferable Skills:**  
✔️ **Python Instruction** → Security Scripting  
✔️ **Network+ Teaching** → Traffic Analysis  
✔️ **Project+ Knowledge** → Security Policy Development  

## 🔬 Featured Labs
| Lab | Tools | Skills Demonstrated | Report |
|-----|-------|---------------------|--------|
| [Wireshark: Port Scan Detection](labs/wireshark/) | Wireshark, TCP/IP | Network Forensics | [PDF](reports/wireshark_analysis.pdf) |
| [Python Log Analyzer](scripts/log_parser.py) | Pandas, Regex | SIEM Simulation | [Notebook](scripts/log_analysis.ipynb) |
| [Active Directory Hardening](labs/active-directory/) | Hyper-V, PowerShell | Enterprise Security | [Guide](labs/ad/README.md) |

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
```python
# Sample Threat Detection (Python)
import pandas as pd

def detect_bruteforce(logs, threshold=5):
    """Identifies brute force attempts from logs"""
    suspicious = logs[logs['failed_logins'] > threshold]
    return suspicious[['src_ip', 'timestamp']]
```

**Core Proficiencies:**  
- **Threat Hunting**: Wireshark, Zeek, Splunk (Free Tier)  
- **GRC**: NIST CSF, ISO 27001 Fundamentals  
- **Automation**: Python (Pandas, Requests), PowerShell
